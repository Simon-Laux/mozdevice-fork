# mozdevice - fork

mozdevice is an rust adb client, its the most complete one I could find at the time.

I made this fork, because I have no idea how the mozilla dev stuff works and even less clue about the mercurial VCS.

it's forked from https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/testing/mozbase/rust/mozdevice
